The simplest and safest way to clone your Arch Linux installation to a larger drive is by using rsync. This method avoids issues with direct disk cloning and gives you flexibility with partition sizes and filesystems.

‚úÖ Overview: rsync method (recommended)
You‚Äôll:

Partition & format the new drive.

Mount it.

Use rsync to copy everything.

Chroot into the new system and reinstall the bootloader.

üîß Step-by-Step Guide
‚ö†Ô∏è These commands must be run as root. Use sudo -i to enter a root shell.

1. Identify disks
Check your current disk and new target disk:

bash
Copy
Edit
lsblk -f
Assume:

Your current drive: /dev/sda

New larger drive: /dev/sdb

2. Partition & format the new drive
Use cfdisk, fdisk, or gparted to partition /dev/sdb.

Example (GPT + EFI):

Partition	Mount Point	Format	Notes
/dev/sdb1	/boot/efi	vfat	EFI System Partition
/dev/sdb2	/	ext4	Root filesystem

Then format:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sdb1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2
3. Mount new root
bash
Copy
Edit
mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/boot/efi
4. Clone with rsync
bash
Copy
Edit
rsync -aAXHv --exclude={"/dev/*","/proc/*","/sys/*","/tmp/*","/run/*","/mnt/*","/media/*","/lost+found"} / /mnt
This will copy your full system while preserving permissions, ACLs, and symlinks.

5. Chroot into the new system
bash
Copy
Edit
arch-chroot /mnt
Now you're in the new system.

6. Reinstall the bootloader
If using systemd-boot (for EFI):
bash
Copy
Edit
bootctl --path=/boot install
Ensure /boot/loader/loader.conf and /boot/loader/entries/*.conf are correct.

If using GRUB:
bash
Copy
Edit
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
7. Update fstab
Still inside chroot:

bash
Copy
Edit
genfstab -U / > /etc/fstab
Double-check with:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat /etc/fstab
8. Exit & reboot
bash
Copy
Edit
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
In your BIOS/UEFI, boot from the new drive.

‚úÖ Done!
You‚Äôve now cloned your Arch system to a new drive using rsync.

üßä Bonus: Want a raw sector-by-sector clone instead?
Use dd:

bash
Copy
Edit
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=64K status=progress
‚ö†Ô∏è This clones everything, including UUIDs and partition sizes. You‚Äôll need to resize partitions afterward (e.g., using gparted or parted + resize2fs), and you may face bootloader UUID issues.

Would you like a script version of the rsync method?

Here's a scripted version of the rsync cloning method ‚Äî assuming:

You're cloning from your current running Arch system.

Your new drive is /dev/sdb.

You are using EFI + systemd-boot or EFI + GRUB.

Your partitions on /dev/sdb are already created and formatted:

/dev/sdb1 = EFI partition (vfat)

/dev/sdb2 = root (ext4)

‚úÖ Arch Clone Script (rsync method)
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
# clone-arch.sh ‚Äî clone Arch to a new drive using rsync
# WARNING: Assumes new partitions are already created and formatted!

set -euo pipefail

### Adjust these to match your setup
EFI_PART="/dev/sdb1"
ROOT_PART="/dev/sdb2"
MNT="/mnt/clone"

echo "==> Mounting new root partition..."
mkdir -p "$MNT"
mount "$ROOT_PART" "$MNT"

echo "==> Mounting EFI partition..."
mkdir -p "$MNT/boot/efi"
mount "$EFI_PART" "$MNT/boot/efi"

echo "==> Starting rsync copy..."
rsync -aAXHv \
  --exclude={"/dev/*","/proc/*","/sys/*","/tmp/*","/run/*","/mnt/*","/media/*","/lost+found"} \
  / "$MNT"

echo "==> Chrooting into the new system..."
arch-chroot "$MNT" /bin/bash <<'EOT'
echo "==> Inside chroot: Generating fstab..."
genfstab -U / > /etc/fstab

# Choose either systemd-boot OR grub below:

# --- Systemd-boot ---
# echo "==> Installing systemd-boot..."
# bootctl install

# --- GRUB ---
echo "==> Installing GRUB bootloader..."
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

EOT

echo "==> Unmounting cloned system..."
umount -R "$MNT"

echo "‚úÖ Clone complete. Reboot and select the new drive in UEFI boot menu."
üìù How to Use:
Ensure /dev/sdb is partitioned and formatted:

EFI: mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sdb1

Root: mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2

Make script executable:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x clone-arch.sh
Run as root:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ./clone-arch.sh
‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
Adjust device paths (/dev/sdb1, etc.) as needed.

It assumes you're using UEFI.

Uncomment the appropriate bootloader section (GRUB or systemd-boot).

Don't run this if the new drive is mounted anywhere else.

Always double-check lsblk or fdisk -l before running.
